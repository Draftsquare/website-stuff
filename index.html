                I am Alex, I made this site for both enjoyment and as a project for my coding class. 
                But that doesn't mean it's not full of stupid stuff. Now I could fill this section up with
                nonsense and spam, but I won't, because I'm better than that. Speaking of being better, 
                did you know a cloud weighs a million tons? Or that giraffes are 30x more likely to be 
                struck by lightning? Weird, right? Imagine being born with a long neck and Zeus flinging 
                thunderbolts like Gamefreak throws Pidgeys at players on Route 1. Is this random text? 
                No, it's not. This is all very important, you'll understand when you're older. What's that?
                You're older than me? then shhhh. You know too much, old man/woman. Are you still reading
                this text gar-I MEAN, this wonderful block of text? I recommend playing Titanfall 2. Go play it.
                It revolutionized the mover-shooter First Person Payer genre. You get to kill people in tanks!
                Freakin' TANKS! We're talking like, gundam! Huge robots you get to control, think of all the
                war crimes you can commit! The Geneva Convention are only GUIDELINES in this game! A grunt NPC
                trying to surrender? Kill em'! Kill them all! Uh, I mean, don't do that. Bad. Bad reader. 
                Don't break Geneva Conventions. We respect war crime guide-UH, WAR CRIME RULES. Yeah. That.
                One more thing. I hid a link on this page somewhere. It's towards the top. If you
                inspect element this page for it I'll personally hunt you down and stick you in garbage bin.
 
                <span>Don't do warcrimes. (:</span>
